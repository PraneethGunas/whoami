# About Me

Hi, I'm Praneeth! I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). My concentration focuses on network security and software engineering research. I've also taken up open-source intelligence on the side.

I've worked at Bithyve building a secure Bitcoin mobile wallet that helps you self-custody your keys. I led the hardware integrations with the mobile app and helped the team build scalable applications securely. 

I was a speaker @[Bitcoin4India](https://bitcoin4india.org/). Spoke about "Securing Bitcoin with Multisig".
Hosted multiple Bitcoin meetups in and around Bangalore to elicit about Bitcoin.
Open-sourced libraries that can efficiently establish a bridge between hardware wallets and mobile applications.

I aspire to be a mobile security engineer and build in public. I enjoy solving CTF challenges on HackTheBox.

Outside of work, I play a lot of [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/crushedhammock), brainstorm startup ideas, and make great chai ☕️ I also enjoy learning about human psychology/behavior and help better visualize things.
