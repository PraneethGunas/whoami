# What's in my Masters?

## Network Security
> We focus on key protocols like TLS, DNSSEC, Routing, and Email Security, while exploring vulnerabilities and countermeasures. Recent study areas include certificate pinning in mobile apps, QUIC adoption, and its scalability, Destination-Side Source Address Validation (DSAV), Adoption of Route Origin Validation across autonomous systems etc. Iâ€™m currently trying to alayse reply attacks in TLS 1.3 during the data trasfer in 0-RTT handshake at the time of session resumption

## Systems and Security

> We built the [Interprocedural Cryptographic API Misuse Dataset](https://github.com/PraneethGunas/CryptoFlowSafety) (TypeScript) to provide practical examples of secure and insecure cryptographic API usage within cryptocurrency applications. My focus was on demonstrating how security properties can propagate across different functions and modules, uncovering vulnerabilities that could lead to significant financial losses.

## Blockchain Technologies
> Developed a robust, Rust-based [command-line tool](https://github.com/PraneethGunas/bitcoin-multisig-wallet) for key recovery in m-of-n Bitcoin multisig schemes. This addresses the
critical vulnerability of standard multisig wallets, where the loss of even a single original public key can prevent recovery, even if all private keys are retained. My tool enables recovery with only 'm' keys, significantly improving operational resilience using OP_RETURN.
