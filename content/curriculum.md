## Network Security
> We focus on key protocols like TLS, DNSSEC, Routing, and Email Security, while exploring vulnerabilities and countermeasures. Recent study areas include certificate pinning in mobile apps, QUIC adoption, and its scalability, Destination-Side Source Address Validation (DSAV), etc. Iâ€™m currently trying to alayse reply attacks in TLS 1.3 during the 0-RTT handshake
&nbsp;

## Software Engineering Research

> We work on developing and improving general software engineering practices, addressing issues like flaky tests, replacing text differencing with Gumtree to better understand developer intent, etc.
I'm currently building a smart home automation simulator for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
> We learn to ethically stalk by efficiently consuming publically available resources to generate intelligence in fields like cybersecurity, finance, business, law enforcement, etc. We use techniques like dorking, scraping, data mining, and advanced search algorithms and prioritize compliance with legal and ethical standards
