Hi, I'm Praneeth! I'm currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). I've recently started my research thesis under [Dr Shin'ichiro Matsuo](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/matsuo/) and [Dr Wenjing Lou](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/WJLou.html) in Blockchain and Network Security at the [Commonwealth Cyber Initiative](https://cyberinitiative.org/).

I've worked at Bithyve building a secure Bitcoin [mobile wallet](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/bitcoin-keeper/id1545535925) that helps you self-custody your keys. I led the hardware integrations with the mobile app and helped the team build scalable applications securely. 

I was a speaker @[Bitcoin4India](https://bitcoin4india.org/). Spoke about "Securing Bitcoin with Multisig".
Hosted multiple Bitcoin meetups in and around Bangalore to elicit about Bitcoin.
Open-sourced libraries that can efficiently establish a bridge between hardware wallets and mobile applications.

Outside of work, I play a lot of [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/crushedhammock), brainstorm startup ideas, and make great chai ☕️ I also enjoy learning about human psychology/behavior and help better visualize things.
